[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m a Ph.D. student working on deep learning, jointly supervised by Giulio Biroli and Levent Sagun. I share my time between the Center for Data Science of ENS Paris and Facebook AI Research. Prior to that, I studied Theoretical Physics at ENS, and worked with NASA on black hole mergers.\nMy research focuses on understanding and improving the ability of deep neural networks to generalize well. On one hand, I use approaches from statistical mechanics to analyze toy models. On the other hand, I investigate how different types of inductive biases affect learning, from fully-connected networks to convolutional networks to transformers. I have also worked on bio-inspired alternatives to backpropagation and applications of deep learning in maths and physics.\nI love communicating science to the general audience. I wrote a couple books and participated in a few podcasts and conferences about AI and physics. In my spare time I also play the clarinet, feel free to check out some of my videos !\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sdascoli.github.io/author/stephane-dascoli/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/stephane-dascoli/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
