[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m a Ph.D. student working on deep learning, jointly supervised by Giulio Biroli (ENS Paris) and Levent Sagun (FAIR Paris). Before that, I studied Theoretical Physics and worked with NASA on black hole mergers.\nMy research focuses on understanding how deep neural networks are able to generalize despite being heavily overparametrized. On one hand, I use tools from statistical mechanics to study simple models, and try to understand when and why they overfit. On the other hand, I investigate how different types of inductive biases affect learning, from fully-connected networks to convolutional networks to transformers. I am also interested in bio-inspired alternatives to backpropagation.\nI love communicating science to the general audience, and wrote a couple books for this purpose. In my spare time I also play music, feel free to check out my videos!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sdascoli.github.io/author/stephane-dascoli/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/stephane-dascoli/","section":"authors","summary":"Hi!
